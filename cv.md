##  *About Myself:*
I lived in Italy for a while, after some time a pandemic started there, which was the starting point for me to look for a new profession. That's when I started to look at the IT field, before that I never thought I could do it, because I thought it was too complicated for me. 


I was wrong) After some research, I chose a language to study C++, and after some time, my friends advised me to pay attention to Javascript. 
And the very next day I began my journey into the world of web development and to this day am trying to master such a profession as a front-end developer.


I studied everything on my own, but for the time being I attended courses at the Hillel IT-school to speed up the learning process. 
I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and slowly made one-page sites to develop my skills. Then I started to learn Javascript, and just at that time I was offered an internship which I easily passed. After some time of training I was given a commercial project which I tried to do but after a week the internship was closed, it was not explained to me and I went back to self training.
